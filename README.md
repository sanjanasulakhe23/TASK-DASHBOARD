# ðŸŽ¨ Cartoon Task Dashboard

**Cartoon Task Dashboard** is an interactive, fun, and visually appealing task management application built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**. It is designed as a **practice project** for learning and strengthening core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage, and API integration.

> **Note:** This project is created purely for **JavaScript practice** and experimentation. It is not intended for production use.

## Overview

This project allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks in a **cartoon-style dashboard**. Each task comes with a randomly assigned emoji avatar and a priority level (High, Medium, or Low). Users can mark tasks as completed, filter tasks based on their status, and view overall statistics about their task list.  

To make the dashboard more engaging, the application fetches random jokes from a public API and allows switching between light and dark modes. The goal of this project was to practice **interactive web development** entirely in JavaScript without relying on external frameworks.
